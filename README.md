### About

This is a dungeon-like terminal in which the user plays a magical character, and is on a journey to beat the enemies and get to the final floor, finishing the game while collecting as much gold as they can.

### Implementation Details

We used several Object oriented programming principles in the design of this application in order to create a robust, resilient to change game. We used the strategy and visitor design patterns and concepts such as Inheritence, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism.
